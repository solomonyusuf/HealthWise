## Quick Reference - Key Files and Entry Points

### Critical Files for UI/UX Enhancements

-   **Auth Pages Layout & Styling**: `resources/views/shared/auth.blade.php`
-   **Login Page**: `resources/views/pages/login.blade.php`
-   **Registration Page**: `resources/views/pages/register.blade.php`
-   **Dashboard**: `resources/views/pages/dashboard.blade.php`
-   **Dashboard Chart Logic**: `app/Http/Controllers/ChartController.php`
-   **Lifestyle & Dietary Page**: `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
-   **Main CSS**: `public/style.css`

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The project is a Laravel application. Frontend pages are rendered using Blade templates. Styling is a mix of Bootstrap, a custom stylesheet (`public/style.css`), and inline styles within Blade files.

### Actual Tech Stack

| Category    | Technology | Version | Notes                               |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Runtime     | PHP        | 8.1+    | (Based on Laravel 10 requirements)  |
| Framework   | Laravel    | 10.x    |                                     |
| Frontend    | Blade      |         | Laravel's templating engine         |
| CSS         | Bootstrap  | 5.3.0   | Loaded via CDN                      |
| Charts      | Unknown    |         | Via `ChartController` - likely a wrapper for a charting library. |

## UI/UX Enhancement Details

### 1. Auth Page UI

-   **Files**: `resources/views/shared/auth.blade.php` is the primary file.
-   **Current State**: The background is a purple linear gradient defined in an inline `<style>` block.
-   **Task**: Modify the `background` property in the `body` style rule within `auth.blade.php` to use a different color scheme.

### 2. Input Field Placeholders

-   **Files**: `resources/views/shared/auth.blade.php` and `public/style.css`.
-   **Current State**: Placeholders are using the browser's default dark color, which conflicts with the input field's background.
-   **Task**: Add a new CSS rule to target `::placeholder` for the input fields. This can be added to the inline style block in `auth.blade.php` for a quick fix, or to `public/style.css` for a more global solution. A light grey color should be used.

### 3. Dashboard Charts

-   **Files**: `resources/views/pages/dashboard.blade.php` and `app/Http/Controllers/ChartController.php`.
-   **Current State**: The dashboard displays one chart, generated by `ChartController`.
-   **Task**: To add more charts, the `ChartController.php` needs to be analyzed to understand how to create new chart instances. Then, the new chart variables can be passed to the `dashboard.blade.php` view and rendered in a similar way to the existing chart.

### 4. Lifestyle & Dietary Recommendation Page

-   **Files**: `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` and `public/style.css`.
-   **Current State**: This page contains sections for "Lifestyle Assessment" and "Lifestyle Recommendations". The UI is basic HTML with some custom styling.
-   **Task**: The UI needs to be improved to be more intuitive and visually appealing. This will involve modifying the HTML structure in `welcome.blade.php` and adding new styles to `public/style.css`. Action buttons, like a "Print" button, can be added to the HTML. Javascript may be needed for the print functionality.

## Development and Deployment

### Local Development Setup

1.  Run `composer install`
2.  Run `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and configure the database.
4.  Run `php artisan key:generate`
5.  Run `php artisan migrate`
6.  Run `php artisan serve` to start the development server.
